# ClearScan

ClearScan is an innovative web and mobile application designed to empower individuals with partial vision impairment by converting scanned text into natural-sounding speech—both online and offline. Built to support the Indonesian language with high accuracy, ClearScan addresses the everyday challenges faced by those who struggle to read standard texts on product packaging, documents, and signage.

## Background

In Indonesia, approximately 3.7 million people experience visual impairments, with many suffering from partial blindness that hinders their ability to read. While applications like Google Lookout and Seeing AI offer OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) functionalities, they are not fully optimized for the Indonesian language and often require a stable internet connection. ClearScan fills this gap by providing a dedicated solution for accurate, offline-friendly text scanning and reading.

## Problem Statement

- **Empowerment:** How can we help individuals with partial vision impairment read text more easily and independently?
- **Accuracy:** How can we improve OCR and TTS accuracy specifically for Indonesian text, including local nuances and accents?
- **Accessibility:** How can we create a lightweight, user-friendly solution that functions seamlessly both online and offline?
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** How can we ensure that our solution is more effective and affordable compared to existing alternatives?

## Proposed Solution

ClearScan leverages advanced OCR technology to convert text from images or documents into digital text, which is then transformed into speech via a high-quality TTS engine. The application is purposefully engineered to:
- Recognize and accurately process Indonesian text.
- Offer offline functionality for consistent performance.
- Provide user-friendly features that enhance accessibility for individuals with partial vision impairment.
